# CMSE202-Final_Project
a README.md file in the GitHub repository that explains how to run the code and a description for what each group member contributed to the overall project


The code has two parts. One Part being the graph of the model relationship with each other and the K-Means graphs. The second part of the project being the Preference Class. These both parts answered all our questions that we wanted to answer. Our Group consisted of Raghunadh Puram, Mattie Mason, and Reeta Bhanini. Everything is in order, so starting at the top and running it, will give all the information that we gathered in a accurate way. We first started out by finding what dataset works best for us and what was able to answer the questions we had so that the reader can understand it. We divided up the project by having Reeta & Raghu work on the OLS models and the K-Means graphs while Mattie worked on the Preference class.
